# Weather-App-UI-ios-
This is a very basic UI for a weather app created using SwiftUI for iOS,
This is my first experience with SwiftUI,
Used lineargradient to adjust the background colour,
Used Zstack, Vstack and Hstack to create several updates for the page,
Used SF symbols extensively to make the UI look more elegant,
Using Structures extensivly to optimize  and clean the code,
Used @binding  and @state to toggle between the day and night,
Used A button to change th UI according to day and night.
